            Steve Johnson.<br>
            He is 25 years old now. Last three years, he spent in jail for a mysterious robbery. He and Andy, his friend, sneaked into a rich man’s house. They succeed to open his safe, stole some jewelry but that’s it, cops didn’t find where they hid those stuff.<br>
            Steve is not a dangerous criminal. He was just a thief. However, in that time, he really needed some money for his mom’s disease.<br>
            He thought he could change his tragedy with this adventure. But he failed.<br>
            Not because he got arrested but his mom dead when he was in jail.<br>
            Now he feels regretful for his past and tries to be a civil citizen.<br>
            This day when Steven walks in Charlestown street at night, he just finished his tiring job and wanted to go home, he finds two people are struggling with each other not far away.

            When he tries to find another way home, he hears the screaming from the victim. It sounds a young student. He knows there are some students live here.<br>
            Steve hesitates.

            Steve arrives home. After a tiring day, he walks into the bathroom.<br>
            He takes a long shower because he wants to relax and makes him relieved from the terrible memory that he just saw, but he failed. He recalls that scene repeatedly. Moreover,  he finds that thug’s figure is so familiar. After that shower, he doesn’t go to bed. Some memories eat him up inside gradually. He opens TV and switch to news, but he doesn’t see the horrible crime scene is reported. Of course, it wouldn’t show up in the news, it just happened before several hours.<br> Steve may find news about that crime in tomorrow but he hopes he will never see that report.

            When Steve gets close to that two people, at first, he just wants to figure out what happened, if there’s someone is attacked, he wants to help him. He is never a brave guy who desires to be a hero, even when he was a child. However, at least, he still has a little conscience. If it’s just a normal fighting, he doesn’t want to get involved in it, but it’s not going as he thought. The thug pulls out something stabs the other guy. That guy lies down rapidly with a scream.<br> Things become complicated and dangerous.

           Under the dim road light, the figure of that thug becomes clear.<br>
            That’s Ted. Steve doesn’t just know him, but hate him.<br>
            When he was in jail, he experienced many desperate things, but nothing can compare with his mom’s death. Steve totally cracked up. He even tried to kill himself, but. Andy saved him. <br>
            His friend Andy told him, though his mom dead for heart disease in her house. However, there was something unusual happened in that night. Andy bribed a cop to peep this so-called accident, he found and told Steve, there was a guy used to break into his mom’s house before her death.<br>
            It’s possibly the reason she got a heart attack, but due to lack of direct evidence to prove this stealing behavior caused her death, that guy who broke into was not accused of murder by jury and judge. <br>
            Where is the wheel of justice? It not only turns slowly, but also never arrives. Steve feels isolated time after time. He is pretty sure his poor mom was frightened by the guy who broke into house.<br>
            That guy named Ted. Now he is standing in front of Steve.<br>
            In the other side, the guy who was stabbed by Ted, he looks injured very seriously, he’s dying on the ground.

            Ted noticed Steve immediately but he doesn’t hurt him at once.<br>
            They have met in jail before. But it seems Ted doesn’t know anything about Steve and his mom.<br>
            Ted has no idea the old lady who died when he broke into the house was Steve’s mother.<br>  
            Ted:“What the fucking are you doing?! You gonna kill me.”<br>

            Steve: “But that couldn’t happen!”<br>
            Steve get confused. He thought Andy is his only reliable friend, but Ted’s words mess everything up.<br>
            Is this a lie, but why Ted need to lie to him now?<br>

            Steve goes back to his blue life. Maybe it’s just his coward cause this consequent. If gave him another chance, he wants to do something different.
